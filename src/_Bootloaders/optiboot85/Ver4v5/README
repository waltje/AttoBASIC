This is disassembled and reOPTImized optiboot version of Tom's optiboot from
https://github.com/TCWORLD/ATTinyCore/tree/master/tiny/bootloaders/optiboot.

Nothing special, just an attempt to learn AVR ASM flavour on a practical example.

Achievements: 
Reduced code size to 0x1FC allowing to fit the loader to last 8 pages.
Using T1 for led flashing

Targets:

Amend attiny arduino core to use optiboot's softuart

Using softuart port ArduinoISP to attiny making tiny AVR ISP programmer

Using softuart port ArdPICprog to attiny making tiny PIC ISP programmer
