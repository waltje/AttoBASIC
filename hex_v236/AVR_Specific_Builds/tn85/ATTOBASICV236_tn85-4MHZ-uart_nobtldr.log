Notice:
The register and instruction counts are symbol table hit counts,
and hence implicitly used resources are not counted, eg, the
'lpm' instruction without operands implicitly uses r0 and z,
none of which are counted.

x,y,z are separate entities in the symbol table and are
counted separately from r26..r31 here.

.dseg memory usage only counts static data declared with .byte
